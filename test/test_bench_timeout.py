"""Tests for the per-request timeout guards in :mod:`tokenspeed.bench`.

These tests don't talk to a real server; they exercise the timeout helper
directly. The point is to lock in the behaviour that one stuck
stream-response future cannot deadlock the outer ``asyncio.gather``: instead
it surfaces as a normal ``RequestFuncOutput`` marked failed.

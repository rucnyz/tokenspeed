# CI Task Specs

`test/ci/` is the source of truth for CI task declarations consumed by
`test/ci_system/pipeline.py`.

Current trigger values:

- `per-commit`
- `manual`
- `nightly`

Supported task types:

- `ut`
- `server_smoke`
- `eval`
- `perf`

Currently configured task directories:

- `eval`
- `ut`

Each task expands into one matrix entry per runner label. Add a top-level
`priority` to a task YAML to bias dispatch order. GitHub Actions starts matrix
jobs in include-list order, so `high` entries reach a contended runner pool
before `normal` (the default) and `low`. Tasks that omit `priority` keep their
original ordering.

`priority` accepts either a scalar (applies to every label of the task) or a
per-label mapping (only the listed labels are overridden; every other label
stays at `normal`):

```yaml
# whole task at high
priority: high

# only the b300-1gpu instance drops to low; h100-1gpu / b200-1gpu / ...
# of the same task keep the default normal
priority:
  b300-1gpu: low
```

Typical use: lower a 1gpu kernel unit-test on `b300-1gpu` so the heavier
b300-4gpu evals that share the same box claim the runner first, without
disturbing the same task's ordering on the other GPU families.

`b200-<Ngpu>` labels are the default B200 runners. Set the
`TOKENSPEED_B200_RUNNER_LABEL` repository variable in GitHub Actions
(`Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions` -> `Variables`) to a
non-empty runner family such as `b200v2` to temporarily route them to
`b200v2-<Ngpu>` without editing task YAML. Leave the variable unset or empty to
use the default `b200-<Ngpu>` labels.
The CI system derives `SM` from common runner label prefixes by default:
`h100`/`h200` use `sm90`, `b200`/`gb200` use `sm100`, and `b300`/`gb300` use
`sm103`. Use `runner.env.<label>` only for environment variables that should
override or extend the defaults for a single runner label.

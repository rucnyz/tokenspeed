"""Lightweight FastAPI HTTP server exposing tokenspeed's AsyncLLM.

Provides an sglang-compatible HTTP surface for control-plane operations such as
memory occupation management (POST /release_memory_occupation,
POST /resume_memory_occupation) and cache flushing (POST /flush_cache).

This server is intended for direct use in tests, PD-disaggregated node
deployments, and any scenario that requires an HTTP endpoint backed by a
running AsyncLLM instance.  Production deployments use the SMG gRPC servicer
instead; see ``tokenspeed.cli.serve_smg``.

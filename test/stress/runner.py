"""Arrival processes + lifecycle orchestration.

A workload is an async generator that yields ChatRequest objects. The runner
decides *when* each yielded request fires (constant rate, Poisson arrivals,
or burst pattern) and caps in-flight concurrency.

Includes a simple circuit breaker: if requests fail back-to-back faster than
they succeed, the runner trips open and stops dispatching new work for a
cool-off window. Without this, a dead server turns "constant" arrival into a
tight loop that emits millions of ClientConnectorErrors per minute.

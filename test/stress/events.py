"""Structured events + JSONL sink.

Every interesting thing that happens during a stress run -- a request starting,
getting its first token, being cancelled, a health-probe status flip -- is
recorded as a single JSON object on its own line. Post-run tooling consumes
this file; nothing else needs a shared in-memory schema.

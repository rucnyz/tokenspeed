"""Malformed schemas that xgrammar should reject during compile.

The expected behavior: the request finishes with an abort / error
response that surfaces the compile failure — not a server crash, not
a hang, not a successful "pretend it's valid" generation. A crash or
hang here is a hole in the GrammarManager error path (grammar future
failure propagation, cache-of-failure semantics).
